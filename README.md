Current Cost Monitor
====================

This code reads data from a serial port and pushes it into an RRD database. Various scripts to create the database and generate graphs from it can be found in the src/ directory as can scripts for starting as a service under Ubunut.

The "other side" of the serial cable is a Current Cost 128 energy monitor. This is connected via a radio link to an ammeter attached to the power trunk into my house.
